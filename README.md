Graduate course in Computer Vision in Spring'22 at UC Riverside

I am taking graduate Computer Vision course during Spring'22. This repository will contain all the assignments, final course project and other important algorithms implemented throughout the quarter.

# Contents

1. Edge detection \
  a. Laplacian filter\
  b. Canny edge detector\
  c. Hough transform
  
2. Fourier transform and basis images.
3. Shi-Tomasi corner detector with the following features\
  a. Sobel operator to obtain the gradients.\
  b. Window size of 5 X 5 \
  c. Suppress points which are not local maxima within a 5 Ã— 5 window.\
  
4. Feature extraction using CNN.
5. Image reconstruction using PCA annalysis.
6. Normalized cuts for image segmentation.
7. Expectation-Maximization algorithm for mixture of Gaussian model based on color features for image segmentation.
